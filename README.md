### Security

Heimdall is protected by a pin code that you'll have to define at first launch. Of course, Heimdall will try to block all other possible ways to disable or uninstall the restrictions.

Forgetting the pin code may avoid the phone to come back to a normal state. Heimdall is not responsible for the consequences of the pin code loss.

### Privacy Policy

Contrary to several other solutions, Heimdall do almost everything on your child phone. This is great for privacy, but this has one drawback: as a parent, you can't control your child's phone remotely.

By default, Heimdall does not use Internet and does not send any data. However, if you purchased and enabled the network filtering feature, Heimdall will send the hostnames of internet requests (e.g. "google.com") in order to be able to recognize the harmful websites. This data is securely send over HTTPS and is not a privacy treat in itself.
