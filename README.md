# Heimdall - Simple and powerful parental control software

Heimdall Parental Control helps you to protect your children by securing his phone and add restrictions.

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.frju.heimdall'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>

### Features

Heimdall needs to be installed on your child's phone and will be secured with a code.

As a parent, you'll be able to:
- avoid installing new application
- restrict the installed applications (block them or add a time limit)
- limit the call duration
- ensure the Google Play/Youtube/... parental filters are enabled (and stay enabled)
- track your child applications or network activities
- block undesired content (adult/illegal websites...) by filtering the phone's network requests (**PAID FEATURE**)

As you can see there is one paid feature. Unfortunately this one actually has some infrastructure costs to be able to recognize the harmful websites. Making it a paid feature is the only solution to be able to provide it.

**Beware of one thing: Heimdall does not provide any remote control.** You will have to take the phone to do restriction modifications.

### Security

Heimdall is protected by a pin code that you'll have to define at first launch. Of course, Heimdall will try to block all other possible ways to disable or uninstall the restrictions.

Forgetting the pin code may avoid the phone to come back to a normal state. Heimdall is not responsible for the consequences of the pin code loss.

### Who am I?

Just a passionated french developper. I created this application for the need of my own family and have absolutly no desire of becoming rich or steal your data. I just hope this application will be as useful for you that it is for me.

### Privacy Policy

Contrary to several other solutions, Heimdall do almost everything on your child phone. This is great for privacy, but this has one drawback: as a parent, you can't control your child's phone remotely.

By default, Heimdall does not use Internet and does not send any data. However, if you purchased and enabled the network filtering feature, Heimdall will send the hostnames of internet requests (e.g. "google.com") in order to be able to recognize the harmful websites. This data is securely send over HTTPS and is not a privacy treat in itself.
